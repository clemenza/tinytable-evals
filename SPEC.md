# tinytable SPEC

`tinytable` is a small, dependency-free, single-table SQL engine: it parses
and executes a subset of SQL (`CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/
`SELECT` with `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX`,
and `SAVEPOINT`/`ROLLBACK TO`/`RELEASE`/`COMMIT`) against an in-memory table.

This document is the **sole arbiter of correct behavior**. `clean/` is a
reference implementation of everything below; a "defect" is any observable
deviation from this spec, nothing more and nothing less. Every SQL example
in this document is a literal, verified statement sequence, true of
`clean/tinytable` today - see "Test Script Format" below for how tests
(official and, later, golden) pin these down as runnable `.test` files.

```python
from tinytable import Database
db = Database()
db.execute("CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)")
db.execute("INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)")
result = db.execute("SELECT x FROM t")   # QueryResult(columns=["x"], rows=[(1,)])
```

`Database` is the only thing a caller needs: one `Database()` per
independent dataset, `execute(sql)` runs exactly one statement and returns a
`QueryResult` (for `SELECT`) or `None` (for everything else). There is no
fixed row schema underneath - rows are plain dicts - but every table a SQL
script can see was `CREATE TABLE`'d, which is what gives `SELECT *` and
column-list-omitted `INSERT` a defined column order (see below).

## SQL Surface

Single table per statement - **no `JOIN`, no subqueries, no `GROUP BY`, no
mixing an aggregate with plain columns in one `SELECT`, no multiple
aggregates in one `SELECT`**. All of these raise `SqlError` with a clear
message rather than doing something unintended. Statements are
case-insensitive for keywords; identifiers are case-sensitive; string
literals use single quotes (`''` inside a literal is one literal `'`); a
trailing `;` is optional and ignored.

```

`CREATE TABLE t (a INTEGER, b TEXT, c BOOLEAN)` declares both column names
*and types* - see "Column Types" below. This declared list is what
`SELECT *` and a column-list-omitted `INSERT INTO t VALUES (...)` use for
positional ordering; an explicit `INSERT INTO t (b) VALUES ('x')` or
`UPDATE ... SET b = 'x'` may still name any column, declared or not - only
a *declared* column's type is enforced (see below), an undeclared one is
untyped, same as if `CREATE TABLE` had never mentioned it. `CREATE UNIQUE
INDEX` both builds a secondary index and adds a uniqueness constraint on
that column (see "Uniqueness" below); a plain `CREATE INDEX` only builds
the index.

`SAVEPOINT`/`ROLLBACK TO`/`RELEASE`/`COMMIT` are **database-wide**: they
apply to every table that currently exists. A table `CREATE`'d after a
`SAVEPOINT` simply has nothing to roll back to for that name (rolling back
does not un-create it); `ROLLBACK TO`/`RELEASE` on a name no table currently
holds raises an error containing `no such savepoint`.

## Column Types

Every `CREATE TABLE` column has exactly one of four types: `INTEGER`,
`REAL`, `TEXT`, `BOOLEAN` (literals `TRUE`/`FALSE`). `INSERT`/`UPDATE`
reject a value whose type doesn't exactly match its column's declared
type, with an error containing `declared <TYPE>`. **`NULL` is always
allowed regardless of declared type** - typing constrains what a
*present* value can be, it says nothing about whether the column can be
absent.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (name TEXT, age INTEGER, active BOOLEAN, score REAL)
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('Ann', 30, TRUE, 4.5)
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('Bo', NULL, FALSE, NULL)   -- NULL is fine for any type
INSERT INTO t VALUES (5, 30, TRUE, 4.5)          -- raises: name is declared TEXT, got INTEGER
```

Type checking is **exact**, not "compatible": a `BOOLEAN` column rejects an
`INTEGER` value even though `TRUE`/`FALSE` and `1`/`0` are
interchangeable in plenty of other SQL dialects - conflating them is
exactly the kind of bug this rule exists to catch, not something to
special-case around.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (active BOOLEAN)
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1)   -- raises: active is declared BOOLEAN, got INTEGER - not accepted as "truthy"
```

An `INSERT`/`UPDATE` naming a column that isn't in the table's declared
list (see "SQL Surface" above - this is allowed, the underlying engine is
schemaless) is simply untyped: no type check applies to it at all.

## NULL semantics (three-valued logic)

This is the single most important rule in this spec.

**`=`/`!=`/`<>`/`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`/`BETWEEN`/`IN` never match when either
side of the comparison is `NULL`** - including when *both* sides are
`NULL`. A `NULL` column value or a `NULL` literal makes the result
"unknown," not "true," even for `x = NULL` or `x != NULL` (which are not
useful ways to test for `NULL` - use `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` instead).

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL)
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x = NULL       -- returns 0 rows: NULL = NULL is NOT a match
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x != NULL      -- returns 0 rows: NULL != NULL is NOT a match either
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x IS NULL      -- returns 1 row: this is how you test for NULL
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (name TEXT, age INTEGER)
INSERT INTO people VALUES ('Ann', NULL)
INSERT INTO people VALUES ('Bo', 30)
INSERT INTO people VALUES ('Cy', 25)
SELECT name FROM people WHERE age != 30    -- returns only 'Cy'
```

`age != 30` excludes Bo because Bo's age *does* equal 30, and - the easy
mistake - it **also** excludes Ann, because a `NULL` comparison never
matches; `age != 30` does **not** silently mean "every age other than 30,
including unknown ones." A caller who wants that must write
`age != 30 OR age IS NULL` explicitly.

`IN (...)`: if the list contains `NULL`, that `NULL` is inert - it can
never cause a `NULL`-valued row to match. `IS NULL` is the only way to
match `NULL`.

A column **never written on a given row** behaves identically to that
column holding `NULL`, for every rule above.

## `ORDER BY col [ASC|DESC] [NULLS FIRST|LAST]`

- **Stable**: rows whose `col` value compares equal keep their relative
  insertion order, in *both* ascending and `DESC` order - `DESC` is a true
  stable descending sort, not "sort ascending then reverse the whole
  result" (which would also reverse the relative order of tied rows).
- **`NULL` placement**: `NULL` rows are placed as a block, either after
  every non-`NULL` row (`NULLS LAST`, the default) or before every
  non-`NULL` row (`NULLS FIRST`) - **independent of `ASC`/`DESC`**. Flipping
  the sort direction reverses the order *within* the non-`NULL` rows; it
  never moves the `NULL` block to the other end.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (k INTEGER, tag TEXT)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 'a')
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 'b')
SELECT tag FROM t ORDER BY k           -- 'a', 'b' (insertion order preserved)
SELECT tag FROM t ORDER BY k DESC      -- 'a', 'b' (still - stable, not reversed)
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2)
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (NULL)
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1)
SELECT x FROM t2 ORDER BY x NULLS LAST         -- 1, 2, NULL
SELECT x FROM t2 ORDER BY x NULLS FIRST        -- NULL, 1, 2
SELECT x FROM t2 ORDER BY x DESC NULLS LAST    -- 2, 1, NULL
SELECT x FROM t2 ORDER BY x DESC NULLS FIRST   -- NULL, 2, 1
```

## `LIMIT n` / `OFFSET n`

Applied in this order: **filter, then order, then offset, then limit** -
i.e. the result is `ordered_rows[offset : offset + limit]`. `OFFSET` skips
from the front of the already-ordered result; `LIMIT` caps how many rows
remain *after* that skip, not before it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (2)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (3)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (4)
SELECT x FROM t ORDER BY x LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1   -- 2, 3: skip 1, THEN take 2
```

A negative `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` is a syntax the grammar above doesn't even
allow (`number` is a non-negative literal); omitting `LIMIT` means
unlimited, omitting `OFFSET` means 0.

## Secondary index: `CREATE INDEX idx ON t(col)`

Builds an index on `col` from the table's current rows (or rebuilds it, if
issued again for the same column - `idx`'s own name is documentation only,
not tracked). An index is a pure performance optimization: **a query
against an indexed column must return exactly the same rows, in the same
cases, as the same query would against an unindexed column** - this is the
central invariant a range-scan bug would violate.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (5)
CREATE INDEX idx ON t(x)
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x >= 5     -- still returns 5: the boundary is included
```

An index only accelerates `=`/`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`/`BETWEEN` against that
column (used alone or as one clause of an `AND`-combined `WHERE`); every
other predicate shape still works correctly, just without the index's help.

## Uniqueness: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx ON t(col)`

Declares that `col` may hold at most one row with any given non-`NULL`
value. Checked immediately against the table's current rows (raises an
error containing `already present` if a duplicate already exists), then
enforced on every subsequent `INSERT`/`UPDATE`.

**`NULL` never participates in uniqueness**: any number of rows may hold
`NULL` in a unique column, simultaneously.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (email TEXT)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq ON t(email)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL)     -- NOT a conflict
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t          -- 2
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (email TEXT)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq2 ON t2(email)
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ('a@x.com')
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ('a@x.com')   -- raises: unique constraint violated ... already present
```

### Uniqueness and `UPDATE`

`UPDATE` validates each matched row's *new* value against every *other*
row's *current* value, processing matched rows one at a time in ascending
row-id order. A row keeping its own existing value is never a
self-conflict:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (email TEXT, n INTEGER)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq ON t(email)
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('a@x.com', 1)
UPDATE t SET n = 2 WHERE email = 'a@x.com'    -- fine - same row, same email
```

A single `UPDATE` cannot swap two rows' unique values in one statement
(giving row A row B's old value and vice versa) - this is explicitly
undefined/unsupported, not a scored behavior.

## `SAVEPOINT` / `ROLLBACK TO` / `RELEASE` / `COMMIT`

`SAVEPOINT name` snapshots **every table's entire state** - rows, every
secondary index's contents, and every unique constraint's contents - under
`name`.

`ROLLBACK TO name` restores that exact snapshot on every table that has it:
rows, index contents, and unique-constraint contents all revert together.
**A query against an indexed column immediately after `ROLLBACK TO` must
return the same result it would if the index had never existed and was
rebuilt from the restored rows from scratch** - this is the invariant a
"rollback leaves stale index entries" bug would violate. `name` remains
valid afterward (you may `ROLLBACK TO` it again); any savepoint created
after it is discarded.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)
CREATE INDEX idx ON t(x)
SAVEPOINT s1
INSERT INTO t VALUES (2)
ROLLBACK TO s1
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x = 2   -- 0 rows: not a stale hit
SELECT x FROM t WHERE x = 1   -- still finds it, via the index
```

`RELEASE name` discards that savepoint, making changes since it was created
permanent (you can no longer roll back to it). `COMMIT` with no name
discards every open savepoint on every table.

## Aggregates: `COUNT(col)`, `COUNT(*)`, `MIN(col)`, `MAX(col)`

Exactly one aggregate per `SELECT`, never mixed with plain columns.
`WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`OFFSET` still apply before the aggregate runs.

- **`COUNT(*)`**: the number of rows, **including** rows where every
  column is `NULL`.
- **`COUNT(col)`** for a real column name: the number of rows where
  `col IS NOT NULL` - `NULL` values are excluded, the same way SQL's
  `COUNT(col)` excludes `NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (x INTEGER)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t     -- 2: includes the NULL row
SELECT COUNT(x) FROM t     -- 1: excludes it
```

- **`MIN(col)` / `MAX(col)`**: ignore `NULL` values, like SQL's
  `MIN`/`MAX`. Return `NULL` if there are no non-`NULL` values to
  aggregate (including an empty result set).

## Errors

| when | message contains |
|---|---|
| a unique constraint is or would be violated | `already present` |
| `ROLLBACK TO`/`RELEASE` a name no table has | `no such savepoint` |
| an `INSERT`/`UPDATE` value's type doesn't match its column's declared type | `declared <TYPE>` |
| a `CREATE TABLE` column with no type, or an unrecognized type name | `expected a column type` |
| a syntax error, or an unsupported statement shape (JOIN, mixed aggregates, missing table, etc.) | (implementation-specific `SqlError` message - not scored on exact wording, only that an error is raised) |

## Test Script Format

Official and (later) golden tests are `.test` files: a small,
sqllogictest-inspired subset, run by `run_sql_tests.py --root <tinytable
install> <file-or-dir>...`. Each `.test` file gets its own fresh `Database`;
statements within one file share state top to bottom.

A file is a sequence of **records**, separated by blank lines. `#`-prefixed
lines are comments (a `# name: ...` line immediately before a record is a
convention for a human-readable label - the runner ignores it as a comment
like any other). Two record kinds:

**`statement ok` / `statement error [substring]`** - every following
non-blank line up to the next blank line is the SQL text (may span multiple
lines). `ok` expects it to execute without raising; `error` expects it to
raise, optionally checking that `substring` appears in the raised message
(see the Errors table above for what to match on).

```
statement ok
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1)

statement error already present
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('a@x.com')
```

**`query <types> [nosort|rowsort]`** - `types` is one letter per expected
result column (`T` text, `I` integer, `R` real, `B` boolean - purely
documentation plus a column-count check; the runner doesn't cross-check a
letter against the SQL column's actual declared type). Lines up to a
line containing exactly `----` are the SQL text (a `SELECT`); lines after
`----` up to the next blank line are the expected result, **one value per
line**, flattened row-major (row 0's columns, then row 1's columns, ...).
`NULL` is written as the literal token `NULL`; a `BOOLEAN` value is written
as `TRUE`/`FALSE` (not `1`/`0` or Python's `True`/`False`). An empty expected block
(`----` immediately followed by a blank line) means zero rows.

`nosort` (the default) requires the exact row/column order returned;
`rowsort` groups both the actual and expected flattened values back into
row-tuples and sorts them before comparing - use this whenever a query's
row order isn't itself the thing being tested (e.g. a plain filter with no
`ORDER BY`), so a test doesn't accidentally pin down an order the spec
never promised.

```
query T rowsort
SELECT name FROM people WHERE dept = 'eng'
----
Ann
Bo

query I nosort
SELECT x FROM t2 ORDER BY x NULLS LAST
----
1
2
NULL
```

This is a deliberately small **subset** of the real sqllogictest format
(no `hash-threshold`, no `skipif`/`onlyif` platform conditionals, no
multi-connection labels) purpose-built for tinytable's single dialect -
`run_sql_tests.py` is not a drop-in replacement for the reference
sqllogictest tooling.
